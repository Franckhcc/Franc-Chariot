The Franc Chariot is an AI-powered, self-driving shopping cart designed for modern supermarkets and retail chains. 
Unlike traditional carts, it independently follows customers, scans products, recognizes items through voice commands or image sensors, 
manages payments, and provides real-time shopping assistance.
